I'm Nick, a rising college junior studying computer science and economics, as well as statistics. I love computer science and math, as well as analyzing issues related to economics and public policy. On this website, I'll be trying to answer some basic questions using the (limited) knowledge that I have. Nothing I write will be conclusive, but hopefully it'll be interesting and at the very least provoke some thought.

<!-- <a href="project-page.html">Projects</a> will present graphs and statistics answering a question. <a href="blog.html">Posts</a> will explain my processes for creating projects or go more into depth on issues while focusing less on presentation. -->
